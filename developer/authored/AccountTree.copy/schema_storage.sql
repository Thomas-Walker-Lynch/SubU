-- schema_storage.sql
--
-- The storage database, standard 5.0, at <SubU dir>/database.sqlite3, where the
-- SubU dir is <storage root>/home/SubU. It records the users kept on the
-- storage. It grants nothing on any system: which of its users have accounts
-- on a system is recorded by that system, in its system database.
--
--   database uuid   names this database; a copy of the database carries it too
--   database uid    a user's uid in this database's own numbering, which counts
--                   down from 1999999999; the user's files on the storage carry it
--
-- A database has no name for people: a name would travel with every copy of
-- the database and come to mislead. It is shown by its database uuid, series
-- number, head hash and the time of its last change.
-- Times are for people to read; the series number in identity is authoritative.

-- This database: its database uuid and the head of its hash chain. One row.
