authority - the one place that answers "may this user do this?"

Every change SubU makes is first put to the authority as a request: the
acting user, the action, the target user, and the resource. Today there is
no authority program, so every request is refused with that reason, and
the window shows every change greyed out. Later this module becomes the
client side of the authority program's interface; the front ends do not
change.
